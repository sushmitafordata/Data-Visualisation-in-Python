## Google Playstore Case Study
In today's data-driven business landscape, the ability to effectively visualize data is paramount to deriving actionable insights and making informed decisions.

This report delves into the significance of data visualization through a compelling Google Playstore Case Study, illustrating its pivotal role in addressing real-world business challenges.

Problem Statement

The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app. You can ask questions like:

Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
